# php-user-crud-login
This snippet was made by Glori4n(https://glori4n.com).

A raw user crud made on PHP that applies most of the concepts involved in the standard creation of those, the objective of this project is to just have a basic CRUD system made with PHP, mySQL and HTML, as well as having a login system using session().

This is an direct upgrade to my previous project: https://github.com/glori4n/php-user-crud.

The SQL file will contain the database as well as users to login, you can create yours directly into it your SQL IDE or you can use any of the accounts, all of their passwords are 123123123.
